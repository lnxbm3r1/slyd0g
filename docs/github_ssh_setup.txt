First, generate a SSH key (if you don't have one)

   If you happen to use GNOME, the seahorse application ("Passwords and
   Encryption Keys") can do it for you: File -> New -> Secure Shell Key.

   If you prefer terminal, run ssh-keygen -t rsa to generate a RSA
   keypair. Other types are dsa (more-or-less equivalent, except
   restricted to 1024 bit keys) and ecdsa (uses much smaller keys with
   same security, but very new and relatively rare).

   If you just press Enter in ssh-keygen, your public key is now stored in
   ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub, and the private one is in ~/.ssh/id_rsa. It is
   highly recommended to leave the paths as they are. (DSA keys will use
   id_dsa, ECDSA – id_ecdsa. Those are just the defaults, and you are free
   to choose any name you want.)

Second, upload the public key to the remote server.

   Again, seahorse can often do that for you - in My Personal Keys,
   right-click on your SSH key and choose Configure key for secure shell.

   And here's the terminal way, step by step:
    1. On the remote server, create a folder .ssh in your home directory.
    2. In that directory, create a file named authorized_keys
    3. Copy your public key (contents of id_rsa.pub) to the remote
       authorized_keys file.

   Short version: scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remoteserver:.ssh/authorized_keys

Third, load the key into ssh-agent.

   If you load your private key into an agent, it will hold the decrypted
   key in memory. Otherwise, you would have have to enter the key's
   passphrase every time you connect.

   To load the key, run
ssh-add

   and enter the key's passphrase. (If your key is not in the default
   location ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you will need to provide the full path. For
   example, ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_ssh_key)

   If ssh-add says "Could not open a connection to your authentication
   agent.", then you don't have a SSH agent running. Launch one using this
   command:
eval $(ssh-agent)

   If you are using GNOME, gnome-keyring-daemon usually provides the same
   SSH agent functionality as ssh-agent, so you should not need to start
   anything. GNOME will automatically load and unlock the key on login,
   too. (I don't use KDE, so I don't know anything about that.)

Fourth, run ssh to connect to the remote server.

   If you loaded your key into the agent as described in step three, ssh
   will automatically use it. Otherwise, it will try to use ~/.ssh/id_rsa,
   ~/.ssh/id_dsa, and (if supported) ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.

   Both scp and sftp, which use ssh to connect, can use the key too.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Notes:
    1. You only need a SSHv2 key, as SSHv1 is very insecure and now
       unused.
    2. You also only need one type of key - either RSA or DSA is enough.
       (If you picked ECDSA, however, it is recommended to create an
       additional RSA or DSA key pair, since very few servers and clients
       support ECDSA this moment.)
    3. All these steps are the same for both RSA and DSA keys. If you use
       DSA, use id_dsa instead of id_rsa, and ECDSA will have id_ecdsa.
       But then, if you care enough to know the difference, you probably
       have figured that out too.
    4. OpenSSH servers older than 3.0 used authorized_keys2 - but it is
       really unlikely you'll find anything older than 5.0 in use.
    5. These instructions only apply for OpenSSH version 3.0 and newer.
       lsh, ssh.com, and other (Unix and not) SSH servers are not included
       in this tutorial.

     ah, you have to say "ssh-add {path-to-private-key-file}" and then it
     will ask you for your passphrase. Please make this more explicit in
     your post. You should also add "Fourth, run ssh". Part of the problem
     with the documentation with this stuff is that it glosses over
     seemingly obvious steps that are NOT obvious for someone new to the
     process who has no idea what's going on and how these programs work
     together. – [31]Jason S Jul 18 '09 at 18:47

   1
     Jason: ssh-add -l is to check if an agent is running. ssh-add without
     arguments will add the key from the default location (which is
     ~/.ssh/id_rsa). Anyway, updated. – [32]grawity Jul 18 '09 at 19:05

     Great answer! It is missing a bit about the file permissions of the key
     files - I just had a problem relating to that today. The private key
     file should only be accessible by me, and the public key file should
     only be writable by me. – [34]ripper234 Oct 28 '10 at 8:42

   You didn't specify what Unix you're on, what Unix you're connecting to,
   what shell you're using, what SSH variant you're using, etc. So some of
   this might need to be adjusted slightly; this is based on reasonably
   recent versions of OpenSSH, which is used on a lot of unix variants.

   This is all from your local desktop system.
ssh-keygen

   Make sure to use the default for the keyname. I suggest that you do set
   a passphrase on that key, otherwise it's a security problem. "-t rsa"
   wouldn't be a bad idea, but probably isn't needed.
ssh-copy-id username@server

   That will ask you for the password you'd use to log in, and sets up the
   authorized_keys stuff for you. (no need to do it by hand)

   Then, this:
`ssh-agent`

   or maybe this:
exec ssh-agent sh

   or:
exec ssh-agent bash

   That will start up an SSH agent that can hold your key. On many modern
   Unix variants, if you're logged in graphically, this will already have
   taken place. The first variant (with the backticks) puts an ssh-agent
   into the background and sets up the environment variables to talk to
   it. The second two have the agent run a shell for you, so that when you
   exit the shell, the agent exits.

   Many modern Unix variants will already have an agent running for you,
   especially if you logged in graphically. You might try "ps aux | grep
   ssh-agent" or "ps -ef | grep ssh-agent"; if something is already
   running, use that.

   Then, finally:
ssh-add

   It will ask for a passphrase; give it the one you gave ssh-keygen.
   There's also ways to make it ask graphically. And you can put the
   ssh-agent and ssh-add stuff into your login scripts (setup is different
   depending on shell you use) to automate this, but some Unix variants
   (current Ubuntu Linux, for instance) do most of that automatically, so
   that all you really need to do is create a key and use ssh-copy-id to
   set it up on the remote host.

   Now, "ssh username@server" should work without asking for any
   authentication. Behind the scenes, it's using a key that the ssh-agent
   is holding, and asking the agent to do the magic signing tricks for it.

   It's possible to do this in [39]PuTTY on Windows as well.

   Once you have the public/private key pair all set up (as other answers
   here show) run PuttyGen. In there, load the existing private key that
   you've already set up, and then save it as a PuTTY private key (ppk).

   Then in PuTTY, just click on the saved session you want to auto-login
   to and click Load. From here go into Connection -> Data in the left
   pane, and in "Auto-login username" type in the username for that remote
   server:

   PuTTY username entry

   After that go into Connection -> SSH -> Auth, and browse for the ppk
   you made in PuttyGen:

   PuTTY private key entry

   Then go back to the session page and save the session you loaded
   earlier.

     PuTTY includes its own version of ssh-agent; it's called Pageant. It
     runs in the system tray and holds your key for you. You do not need to
     ever run ssh-agent, just check "Allow agent forwarding" in PuTTY's
     options under the Auth section, and Pageant's connection will be
     forwarded to the remote end to make your key agent available to it.

   From a very similar question on [46]ServerFault, I'd recommend using
   [47]ssh-copy-id, which does all the steps involved with setting up
   authentication keys for you:

     ssh-copy-id is a script that uses ssh to log into a remote machine
     (presumably using a login password, so password authentication
     should be enabled, unless you've done some clever use of multiple
     identities)

     It also changes the permissions of the remote user's home, ~/.ssh,
     and ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to remove group writability (which would
     otherwise prevent you from logging in, if the remote sshd has
     StrictModes set in its configuration).

     If the -i option is given then the identity file (defaults to
     ~/.ssh/identity.pub) is used, regardless of whether there are any
     keys in your ssh-agent.

   All you need to do is simply this:
ssh-copy-id user@host

   Type in your password once, and you're good to go!

     Your aim

     You want to use Linux and OpenSSH to automize your tasks. Therefore
     you need an automatic login from host A / user a to Host B / user b.
     You don't want to enter any passwords, because you want to call ssh
     from a within a shell script.

    1. On the connecting host, run ssh-keygen. (If it tells you you have
       to specify a type, do ssh-keygen -t rsa.) When it asks you for a
       file location, take the default. When it asks you for a passphrase,
       hit enter for no passphrase.
    2. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or whatever the default file location in
       ssh-keygen was, though you'd have to have a really old ssh install
       for it to be different); copy the output to your clipboard.
    3. Log in normally to the destination host as the account you want to
       connect to. Edit the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (if ~/.ssh doesn't
       exist, slogin to someplace; this is the simple, easy way to get it
       created with the right permissions). Paste your clipboard
       (containing the id_rsa.pub from the other host) into this file.

     First, he asked to not have to type his password; I didn't really think
     that having to type a passphrase instead of his password would be an
     improvement. Second, you're wrong; that's why there's a public key and
     a private key, so the public key can be out in the world. – [65]chaos
     Jul 18 '09 at 17:34
     The password in question is typed during key generation, not every time
     you connect. Correct? – [66]Richard Hoskins Jul 18 '09 at 19:42
     No. Keys generated with a passphrase require the passphrase to be
     entered every time the key is used. – [67]chaos Jul 18 '09 at 20:58

     Wrong. With ssh-agent (see the accepted answer), you type the password
     only once per session. – [68]bortzmeyer Jul 18 '09 at 21:29

   One might argue if using such keys does not require a password. To
   avoid that anyone who gets hold of your private key can actually abuse
   it, one can protect the key by a password of itself.

   Of course, one can leave that password blank, but there's many cases
   where that wouldn't be recommended.

   Apart from all already been told on how to set ssh keys, I recommend
   [79]Keychain as a ssh-agent console frontend which allows you to handle
   one only per system process instead of per login.

   I know there are already GNOME and KDE tools that do the same but if
   you are the console junkie type this is great (and can be used on most
   Unix systems).

   To use it, simply append the following to your ~/.bashrc (similar for
   other shells):
if type keychain >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
  keychain --nogui -q <all your SSH/PGP keys>
  [ -f ~/.keychain/${HOSTNAME}-sh ] && . ~/.keychain/${HOSTNAME}-sh
  [ -f ~/.keychain/${HOSTNAME}-sh-gpg ] && . ~/.keychain/${HOSTNAME}-sh-gpg
